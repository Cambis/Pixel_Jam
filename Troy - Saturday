Hey guys, I've got a few things to do at home so I'll be working from hoome this morning.
I'll probably come in sometime in the afternoon / evening.

If you need to contact me
my email: troy.lamerton@gmail.com
mobile: 027 822 1713

Please let me know as soon as new assets need creating. For now I'll be brainstorming different level designs and the
condition required to win them.
